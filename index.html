        <h2>Flutter</h2>
        <p>I have been learning how to build apps using Dart and the Flutter framework. Flutter is a cross platform framework developed by Google which uses the Skia rendering engine. The great thing about cross platform frameworks is that you can deploy the same codebase to iOS, Android, web, Windows, Mac and Linux. Right now Flutter only fully supports iOS, Android and Web(beta) but the other platforms are said to be coming soon. So far I have been building a simple calendar application which uses a local database to store information.</p>

        <h2>ductivityPRO</h2>
        <p>With the pandemic, most of us are home and I thought this would be the perfect time to build a productivity extension. With recommendation algorithms getting better and better its often really easy to spend far more time on website than you wanted to, this is what inspired me to build ductivityPRO(pro-ductivity).</p>
        <p>Once you install the extension, you'll notice its icon in the toolbar. Clicking this opens up its popup where you can set the amount of time that you want to be on that page. Once this time is over, the extension notifies you and tilts the page preventing you from spending any more time on it. The amount of tilt and the width of the border is fully customizable (both can be set to zero) and can be set from the preferences menu. This can be accessed by clicking the settings icon on the top right hand corner of the popup. Once a timer is set, you can click on the toolbar icon to check how much time is left.</p>
        <p>Another feature is "disable polymer" which can be enabled from the options menu. With YouTube's (relatively) new polymer design, you can't go back into full screen mode once the alarm rings. Once you enable this feature, the extension reverts YouTube to it's old design whenever it detects that you're watching a video. But if you're using this to curb your binge watching addiction you may want to leave YouTube as is.</p>
        <p>In order to put it on addons.mozilla.org, I had to choose a license. This was a really good learning experience because I learned about all the open source licenses and the pros and cons of each one. This is the important but less exciting part of building projects.</p>
        <p>I built a version for Google Chrome as well as Firefox. It was a really interesting process to learn how each platform differed. The current source code on Github has all the features and will work for both platforms.</p>
        <p>The full feature list is on GitHub and in the details on the installation page.</p>
        <p>The extension is available for installation on addons.mozilla.org! <a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ductivitypro/','_blank')">Check it out!</a></p>
        <p>The extension is available for installation on the Chrome Web Store! <a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ductivitypro/ldmdmicajobgfjllgmmcifkmgpohkpji','_blank')">Check it out!</a></p>
